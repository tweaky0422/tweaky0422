        <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Ranked 4th (4th Favorite)</h2>
        <section class="content">
            <div class="column-left">
                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    Tears of the Kingdom by far has the craziest game mechanics out of any other Zelda game.
                     You can pretty much do almost anything in this game as long as you have the patience for it. 
                     Players have made machines and weapons of mass destruction to terrorise all of Hyrule's npcs and baddies.
                     With Link’s mechanical arm, you can do many new things like fuse items with your weapons, or build bizarre and violent contraptions.
                     The normal fighting itself is much like its predecessor, Breath of the WIld.
                     But with enough creativity you can take on pretty much any enemy in any way you’d like.
                     The possibilities are seemingly endless in this game.
                     Which is why I’d give TotK a hard 5 out of 10. As I said, I much prefer a more straightforward way to play, and some of the puzzles were incredibly touchy for me.
                     There was just too much going on, but I do love seeing what other people have done with it.

                    <h3> Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Being a sequel to breath of the wild, TotK picks up a few years after the defeat of calamity ganon.
                         Zelda and her appointed knight link explore the beneath of Hyrule castle, as there has been gloom seeping from beneath.
                          During their expedition they find a mummified Ganondorf. 
                          This mummy had been sealed away centuries ago and has now been awoken.
                           In true Zelda fashion, things get very confusing
                           . Ganondorf decays The Master Sword, a sword to sea away darkness and destroys Link’s arm, and Zelda time travels.
                            Zelda, now in the past, receives the master sword from Link, in the present.
                             There are sages and all sorts of stuff that all vow for their ancestors to defend Hyrule in the future, Zelda begs them to help her in the future.
                              Zelda however, is unable to get to her normal time, and is unable to fix the master sword, at least in her current form.
                               Zelda sacrifices her humanity and becomes a dragon.
                                Confusing, yes, But with her new power she will live to the future, all the while restoring the Master Sword. 
                                In exploring the world, you find this dragon's tears of Zelda’s memories in the past, hence the name tears of the kingdom.
                                 I personally loved this story. It’s hard to follow , but that's usual in a Zelda game.
                                  I enjoyed finding all these memories and loved Zelda’s character, and the amount of sacrifices she makes for her kingdom. 9 out of 10.

                    <h3>Soundtrack</h3>
                    <p>
                        Following in the footsteps of Breath of the wild, this OST is very orchestral.
                     Leitmotifs are in near every song, every sound effect, every encounter making it very enjoyable.
                     Tears of the Kingdom’s OST sits at 11 hours, 52 minutes and 48 seconds.
                     Making it the longest OST there is in the Zelda franchise and almost two times as long as its predecessor.
                     I love the commitment to their sound design, everything is so perfectly blended and meshed.
                    It has some of the most calming tracks I’ve heard, that I often listen to just relax.
                 The implementation of real sounds in songs such as wind, or bug noises, really helps you submerge yourself in the game. 
                 However, some of the songs are too scary and they trigger my girlfriend's fight or flight response.
                 So overall 8 out of 10.
