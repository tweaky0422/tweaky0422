        <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker - Ranked 1st (Favorite)</h2>
        <section class="content">
            <div class="column-left">
                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    While it may not have been my first Zelda game, it was the first Zelda game I was able to actually complete, and as a kid that gave me a rush of accomplishment that I am still chasing.
                     However, this game hasn’t been ported for the Nintendo switch so I’m not as familiar with the story and gameplay as I am with others.
                      The main mechanic of this game is the boat, The King of the Red Lions,  and well, Link’s wind waker, which allows him to direct the King of Red Lions.
                       The controls were much like Ocarina of Time and its past predecessors, but with new improvements, such as better camera control, which made it entirely more enjoyable.
                        The combat in this game is also, in my opinion, incredibly simple. Nice and easy sword swinging and using a grappling hook to get around was just fine by me.
                         My favorite part was sneaking around the fortress which, as anxiety-inducing as it was to not get caught, was the most exciting part.
                          I loved it. Easy and straightforward and timeless. 10 out of 10.

                    <h3>Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        The game starts out reciting a legend from years ago, about The Hero of Time, from Ocarina of Time, and I love a good call back.
                         You then meet Link, his little sister, and an odd pirate girl named Tetra.
                          Link’s little sister almost immediately gets kidnapped, being mistaken as Tetra.
                           This is Link’s call to action. This Link is one of the only Link’s who was not prophesied or foretold, and rather than not having a say in his destiny, he chose to become the hero of wind.
                            It’s important to note that during this time, there was a great flood, and the ocean is nearly everywhere.
                             Link finds the fortress where his sister is and gets whooped completely, and is discovered by a talking boat, my absolute favourite part of the game.
                              The King of Red Lions and Link then set off in a quest to obtain the Master Sword, which will vanquish Ganon.
                               In another encounter with Ganon, they discover that Tetra is actually Zelda, and carries with her the Triforce of Wisdom, which was a surprise to her as well.
                                Link has to yet again set sail to now find the Triforce of courage, which proved Link to be a true hero.
                                 They then go on to defeat Ganon, and everything is great, and it sets up for a sequel, the phantom hourglass.
                                  As a kid this was actually pretty easy to follow, I did what I had to do and why I was doing it made sense. 
                                  Tetra being Zelda was also a very fun twist, and I did give this story a 10 out of 10.

                    <h3>Soundtrack</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wind waker has a very joyful sound to it all, with a more upbeat tone to almost everything that isn't battle related.
                         Being at sea for a good portion of the game had reasoning for many of the tracks to sound very pirate-like. 
                         It also sounds a little more goofy at times, likely due to the cartoon nature of the game, much like Echoes of wisdom.
                          The soundtrack still brings back many memories for me but it doesn't quite stand out like Ocarina of time. 
                          It’s not a soundtrack where I find myself going out of my way to relisten to it, and that’s okay.
                           Maybe if they actually ported it on the switch it would be, but who knows if that will ever happen. 9 out of 10.
