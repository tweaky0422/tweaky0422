        <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Ranked 2nd (Second Favorite)</h2>
        <section class="content">
            <div class="column-left">
                <h3>Gameplay </h3>
                <p>
                    Ocarina of Time was my very first Zelda game, making me forever biased, so yes, I am reviewing, blinded by nostalgia.
                     This game has my all time favorite Zelda tool, the ocarina.
                      With the ocarina you can do things like fast travel and call your horse. 
                    Super simple small things but for me it was game changing.
                 Not to mention I loved the songs you could play on it.
                  The game's controls don't exactly withstand the test of time, but that's alright.
                 The fights are often challenging and I have to admit, I never beat the game as a child, however last year I went back and beat the game.
                  I would always have to go to my dad and try and get him to beat it for me.
                   This game also features time travel, where battling as a young link vs adult link varies.
                    Young Link does not have bombs or a slingshot, and his sword is weak, making certain encounters much more challenging.
                     Even though I had no idea what I was doing then, I can say that I would give it an 8 out of 10 despite all my frustrations.

                    <h3> Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yet another confusing story.
                         You start out as Young Link, a child in the kokiri forest and the only child without a fairy, who’s been having dreams of princess zelda fleeing her castle, despite not knowing her and having never left the forest.
                          He goes to the great deku tree for advice, who gives him an emerald stone and advises him to go to the castle.
                         Link sneaks into the castle, meeting a young Zelda, who tells him of a man she is sure to be evil.
                         Link sets off to find two more stones, only for Ganon to steal them for himself, and this is where it gets messy.
                         Link gets the ocarina allowing him to time travel, he travels to the future and everything is a mess, and Ganon is in control.
                         Link has to go back and forth in between times to save all of Hyrule and find the sages becoming the Hero of Time. 
                        I never understood what was going on in this game, but now that I am older I do, and I can recognize why this is still being called one of the greatest games of all time.
                         Plus it had the craziest twist, discovering Sheik was not only not a boy, but Princess Zelda.
                          8.5 out of 10, I think it's fun.

                    <h3> Soundtrack</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ocarina of Time is the game that made me fall in love with the Zelda soundtrack.
                     I’d never heard such fun music from a game like Zelda. 
                     All I used to play was Mario kart with my brothers.
                      Songs like Zelda’s lullaby, and Lon Lon Ranch still take me back, and I proudly say I still listen to them.
                       Oddly, nothing really puts me more at ease than these outdated songs. 
                    Playing things like the Song of time on the ocarina of time always made me want to get an ocarina of my own, and having an instrument being a key feature in a game is always fun.
                     I especially enjoyed making your own song in order to summon the scarecrow, as it would always be a button mashing of x for me. 
                     Once  again, almost entirely nostalgia based, Ocarina of Time gets a 10 out of 10 for its music.
