        <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Ranked 3th (3rd Favorite)</h2>
        <section class="content">
            <div class="column-left">
                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>    
                    While not as unique as its sequel, this was the blueprint, and you must give credit where credit is due.
                 This may be one of my favorite games gameplay wise, it’s nice and simple.
                 Yes, you can be creative with your takedowns, using elemental weapons and whatnot, but there’s nothing a good flurry rush or parry can’t handle.
                 This game is mostly focused on the hack and slash, hardly using my bow.
                 The movements in which you fight are smooth, and the four guardians you get help from along the way make things like defense, and traversing much easier.
                This is also my girlfriend's favourite gameplay wise as she is not very good at these games, and one of the guardians has a resurrection ability, which without, she would be lost.
                So for that I’m giving gameplay a 8.5 out of 10.               
                </p>

                    <h3> Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Story wise, this game is not nearly as interesting as the other games in the franchise.
                     But it makes up for it in its massive map.
                     You start the game in the shrine of resurrection, waking up to Zelda’s voice and no memories.
                     Link has been asleep for 100 years after nearly dying during calamity Ganon's attack while protecting zelda. 
                    During this time, Zelda has been fighting and holding Ganon off for 100 years on her own.
                 Four divine beasts, all once controlled by a champion, have been taken over by Ganon’s malice, wrecking havoc over hyrule, and link must set out to find the ancestors of these champions, defeat the malice inside of the beasts, and find the master sword.
                 Believe it or not, you can skip all of that and head straight to Ganon, yet doing so will make the encounter much more difficult.
                 Link can also go on a journey to recover some past memories to remember his past.
                 In the end you defeat Ganon, see Zelda and everything is fine.
                 This story, while great, just doesn't stand out to me in any way and isn't as bizarre as I'd hoped, but still great. 7.5 out of 10.

                    <h3> Soundtrack</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is forever one of the most beautiful OSTs of all time.
                     In everything you do there is sound, and no matter what it’s always just the right atmosphere. 
                     I docked many points off TotK because many of its songs were recycled from this one, and due to that, this game just does it better.
                     However, This game contains a song that will always strike the fear of god in me everytime I hear it.
                      This song is Battle:Guardian, and everytime I hear it it's like I'm experiencing my first encounter with a guardian all over again.
                     I love the atmosphere of the game and it is definitely the soundtrack that sets it.
                      Beautiful songs, and even hidden things, like morse code in the themes of the divine beasts.
                       I can confidently say this is a 10 out of 10.
