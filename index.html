        <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Echos of Wisdom - Ranked 5th (Least Favorite)</h2>

                <h3> Gameplay </h3>
                <p> While Echoes of Wisdom is the most recent addition to the Zelda series, it definitely stuck out to me more than any other game in the franchise.
                     This is mostly due to the fact that for the first time in 37 years, you finally get to play as Princess Zelda herself.
                      With this interesting twist, there was bound to be a large contrast from previous gameplay, rather than hacking and slashing your way through dungeons, it was much more strategic.
                       In this game, there are two ways to fight, you can use your Tri Rod, which can create ‘echoes’ of items, such as pots to throw at enemies and summoning previously defeated monsters to defend you against other monsters.
                        Everything you learn to echo over the course of the game has its own unique advantages, allowing the player to find their own creative solution to any puzzle thrown at them. 
                        The other way to fight is to use the Sword of Might, which was Link’s Sword. Using this weapon allows Zelda to take on a Swordfighter Form, where she can fight just as Link would, however this form is only momentarily.
                         Using it for an extended amount of time will deplete its energy gauge, no longer allowing you to use it. This forces you to take advantage of that time limit, getting every hit you can get in. 
                         For gameplay, I am partial to hack and slash style fighting and find some battles here to be too time consuming so I’ll be giving it a 6 out of 10.

                            <h3> Story</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you have any interest in playing this at all, spoiler warning in advance.
                             Earlier I had mentioned that this game really stuck out to me as it is the first game where you play as Princess Zelda.
                             Zelda has and always will be the most prominent character in the series, it’s literally named after her.
                             Zelda has never been weak, occasionally a damsel in distress, but never weak.
                             She’s taken on different aliases, such as Sheik and Tetra, and in Breath of the Wild, fought Calamity Ganon for 100 years straight while waiting for Link’s return.
                             And now in Echoes of Wisdom, it was Zelda saving Link and all of Hyrule.
                                The game opens with you playing as Link, and you defeat Ganon right away, with him disappearing and a mysterious rift opening and swallowing Link.
                                Zelda, having witnessed all of this, returns to Hyrule castle. Upon her return, it seems as if something is off with the king as he banishes his daughter Zelda to be executed.
                                 While in prison Zelda meets this game's companion, Tri, who just so happens to be a rift mender, and also gives Zelda the Tri Rod, allowing her to utilize its abilities for herself. 
                                 More rifts open across the land swallowing people and entire villages, due to Null, opening these and taking everyone to the still world, a distorted reality where everything and everyone is frozen in place.
                                Along their journey,Tri and Zelda mend many rifts all across Hyrule,and the goddesses of Hylia address Zelda herself, and inform Null is trying to get hold of Prime Energy and make everything back to nothingness.
                              It becomes a race against time and Zelda, Link and Tri have a final face off with null, sealing it back into the rift where it was once banished.
                                 Zelda returns to her kingdom, not only a princess but a hero.
                                 Overall I’d give the Echoes of wisdom storyline a 7 out of 10. The only unique thing about this is playing as Zelda and the new villain, Null. It tracks like any other Zelda game otherwise.

                            <h3>Soundtrack</h3>
                            <p>
                                One thing about Zelda games is the soundtrack never misses. 
                                In Echoes of Wisdom, you have your usual themes such as the great fairies theme, which is elegant as ever, yet everything is still different.
                                Echoes of wisdom has a much different sound than the other games, as it feels much more whimsical, almost cartoonish.
                                 I would say it's reminiscent of the mario galaxy soundtrack.
                             I could never dislike any of the old themes from zelda, as hearing them for the first time again in a separate entry of the franchise is always like seeing an old friend.
                             Plus, most the themes are so good, why bother making new ones? One thing that sticks out about this one however is this one has some more eerie and distorted tracks, which is not new whatsoever to the franchise, just not what'd you expect in a cutesy game like this one.
                             In the still world most the music remains ominous, enemy nearby or not.
                             This sound makes it very clear to the player that you are in the enemies territory, Null's banishment grounds.
                             For me, this OST is a solid 7 out of 10 for me, I love the leitmotifs throughout the game, but for me it just wasn’t as good as it could be.
